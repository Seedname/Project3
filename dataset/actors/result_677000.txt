Thus, each episode was in practice a one-off production with its own cast and crew, up to and including the executive producer.\n\nDramarama was largely a place for new talent to prove themselves and was a launching pad for the likes of Anthony Horowitz, Paul Abbott, Kay Mellor, Janice Hally, Tony Kearney, David Tennant and Ann Marie Di Mambro. It was one of Dennis Spooner's last credits.\n\nOne of Dramarama's episodes, \"Dodger, Bonzo And The Rest\", gained so much popularity that it was turned in to its own series the following year. It starred Lee Ross and was based around a large foster home. The episode \"Blackbird Singing In The Dead of Night\" was developed by Granada into the TV series Children's Ward. It was also repeated for the first time since its original broadcast on 5 January 2013, during CITV's 30th anniversary Old Skool Weekend.
