The title of the show is a reference to Superman's home planet Krypton, the title perceiving that the contestants had strong superhuman \"powers\" for taking part in the challenges they were set. The contestants all had their own corresponding colour, either red, green, yellow or blue. They wore their own clothes, apart from the Physical Ability round where the contestants wore track suits which were red, green, yellow or blue until 1989. The track suits changed to black with a coloured stripe. For their own clothes, the contestants either wore a shirt/blouse, tie or a neckscarf of their corresponding colour. The points contestants earned through the game were not referred to as their score, but as their \"Krypton Factor\", e.g. \"The winner, with a Krypton Factor of 46, is the legal secretary from Kent, Mike Berry\".

BBC Radio 1 weathergirl Dianne Oxberry joined for the second series, which began on 28 April 1991.\n\nThe format was very similar to Going Live!, with imported cartoons punctuating items, such as games, music performances and interviews. A regular segment was The Wetter The Better, a game show based in a swimming pool and hosted by Ross King. A weekly drama was shown, in which the short episode ended in a dilemma of some sort. Two endings had been filmed and viewers telephoned to vote which ending would be shown.\n\nIt also incorporated a repeat run of Rentaghost, though all the pre-1980 episodes were omitted and the end-credits rarely seen. Later, episodes of Grandad, starring Clive Dunn, were also shown.\n\nThe theme tune was by Inspiral Carpets: a rewrite of their single \"Find Out Why\".
