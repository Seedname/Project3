Thirty-nine black and white half-hour episodes of Fireball XL5 were made on 35mm film: all future Anderson series were produced in colour.\n\nSeveral Anderson series have been shown in syndication in the US, but Fireball XL5 is the only Anderson series to have run on a US network.

Broadcast on E4 with a late night slot, the series began in 2008, and was an annual event for the soap until 2013, when there was a break, until it returned with a special episode in 2020.\n\nEach of the original series was shown over five consecutive nights.  The late night airing allowed for more sexual content, \"edgier\" storylines, and stronger language.  Each series is a stand-alone story, although each ties in with events on the main show at the time, with the producers often taking advantage of the later broadcast time to tie up loose ends on the more violent and controversial storylines.", "poster_path": "/kQk5qw5ThS2Y3qNrN2TdaOhYEAO.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [18, 10766], "popularity": 6.0825, "first_air_date": "2008-11-24", "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "origin_country": ["GB"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 361837, "title": "Our Town", "original_title": "Our Town", "overview": "This classic American play, performed on an almost-bare stage, is about the mundane but rather pleasant lives of the Gibbs family, the Webb family, and their neighbors in Grover's Corners, New Hampshire, early in the 20th century.", "poster_path": "/qQl0omtZ6iUiiqyL8G6hkO7X3wW.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.2062, "release_date": "1989-04-01", "video": false, "vote_average": 9.0, "vote_count": 1}]}]}
