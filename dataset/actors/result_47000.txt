It was only loosely based on Maurice Leblancs novels.\n\nGeorges Descri\u00e8res' portrayal of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin showed more similarity to Graf Yoster than to Maurice Leblanc's original. He behaved in the first place as a perfect gentleman who never got angry. He was always relaxed, because whatever could possibly had bothered him in daily life was taken care of by his butler. It wasn't questioned how he had come to his financial independence although the series sometimes discreetly implied that he was a professional criminal. Besides rescuing damsels in distress Lupin took on criminals, competing with their wit and intelligence. Either he stole paintings from rich people who had to be considered white-collar criminals or he acted as a detective who derailed criminal schemes. However, when he was attacked, he could defend himself effortlessly by using elegant jujutsu methods.\n\nAmong the guest stars were German actors such as G\u00fcnter Strack and Sky du Mont.\n\nJean-Paul Salom\u00e9 said in his commentary on the DVD version of his film Ars\u00e8ne Lupin he had like this series as a child. German TV, one the investors, would broadcast the show eventually between 18:00-20:00 o'clock because it was only allowed to show commercials within that very timeslot. For them to get a financial return on investment the show had to be appropriate for families and also for children who would watch it alone. Subsequently it was nearby to ask to defuse and flatten some of Leblanc's plots in order to avoid possible complaints that could force the station to broadcast the show beyond the \"Vorabendprogramm\".", "poster_path": "/yQVkbqMT90Q2UFWS9XKtL03TuYb.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "fr", "genre_ids": [10759, 18], "popularity": 4.9939, "first_air_date": "1971-03-18", "vote_average": 7.7, "vote_count": 15, "origin_country": ["FR"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 295970, "title": "Night Train to Milan", "original_title": "Il Criminale", "overview": "A thriller with Jack Palance as a nazi doctor hiding after the war.

Chapman and produced by Thames Television for ITV between 7 March 1984 and 23 October 1986. A ratings success at the time, the show is well remembered for its opening titles featuring a silhouette of a person in a rocking chair.\n\nIt stars Julia McKenzie and Anton Rodgers as Hester and William Fields, a devoted middle-class couple with an idyllic suburban lifestyle. William works while Hester keeps home. The crux of the show was that she was always looking to try new hobbies or find ways to improve her life, much of which exasperated her hard-working husband.\n\nThe family home had a granny flat attached, in which Hester's mother Nancy lived. She was divorced from Hester's father Guy although remarried him as the series progressed. The couple had a daughter called Emma who frequently telephoned but never appeared. Her husband Peter did appear often. They later had a son \u2014 the Fields' first grandchild \u2014 whom they named Guy, after his great-grandfather.\n\nPerhaps, the best remembered supporting character was Sonia Barrett who would frequently pop round to borrow items to replace hers due to breakage, theft or mislaying. Hester was not perturbed by this, as the two were close friends, but it used to irritate William. Sonia had the show's only catchphrase \u2014 she would always knock on the back door of the Fields' home and then say It's only Sonia! as she walked in. This would sometimes lead to applause of recognition from the studio audience, a phenomenon more regularly seen within American sitcoms. Sonia's husband John appeared on occasion, as did William's secretary Miss Denham, played by Daphne Oxenford.", "poster_path": "/yOdUjEw2kih4IAeB2GnGC1QLr4R.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35], "popularity": 2.4731, "first_air_date": "1984-03-07", "vote_average": 6.667, "vote_count": 9, "origin_country": ["GB"]}]}]}
