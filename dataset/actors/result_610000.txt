Alone, Viktor (Sven Wolter) heads off for his usual summer vacation to some islands where he can ostensibly look for antiques for his wife's shop in Stockholm. His marriage is a failure or worse -- he raped his wife before he left home, and he is obsessed by erotic imaginings. Once on the islands, he makes friends with a little girl whose mother is mentally disturbed and is kept by her husband in a locked room. The islanders are as tight-lipped as Viktor, and any communication is stiff and artificial. Viktor's own alienation begins to slip as he takes surprising, violent action to turn around the imprisoned mother's life -- but it does not work, nothing seems to work -- and his last actions indicate that he may not be willing to simply give up.", "poster_path": "/t0ruINSMbRVfDFdKOyteAvVwGDp.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "sv", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 0.2195, "release_date": "1984-03-18", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 471975, "title": "Henry's Shadow", "original_title": "Skuggan av Henry", "overview": "The Swedish IB (Information Bureau) agents Henry Malm and Richard Ramberg travel to the Finnish-Russian border in order to receive a KGB agent who wants to defect.", "poster_path": "/AjyzZAweVDBgpdvaPW5wnnjrFfm.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "sv", "genre_ids": [53], "popularity": 0.1243, "release_date": "1986-01-06", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}]}]}
