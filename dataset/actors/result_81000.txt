The series is notable for being the first one in which the main character came out as gay, which DeGeneres' character did in the 1997 episode \"Puppy Episode\". This event received a great deal of media exposure, ignited controversy, and prompted ABC to place a parental advisory at the beginning of each episode.\n\nThe series' theme song, \"So Called Friend\" is by Scottish band Texas.
