The show was a partially musical comic retelling of the legend of Robin Hood, placing Maid Marian in the role of leader of the Merry Men, and reducing Robin to an incompetent ex-tailor.\n\nThe programme was much appreciated by children and adults alike, and has been likened to Blackadder, not only for its historical setting and the presence of Tony Robinson, but also for its comic style. It is more surreal than Blackadder, however, and drops even more anachronisms. Many of the show's cast such as Howard Lew Lewis, Forbes Collins, Ramsay Gilderdale and Patsy Byrne had previously appeared in various episodes of Blackadder alongside Robinson. Like many British children's programmes, there is a lot of social commentary sneakily inserted, as well as witty asides about the Royal family, buses running on time, etc. Many of the plots spoofed or referenced film and television shows including other incarnations of Robin Hood in those mediums.", "poster_path": "/6baSwjPEaMn7egL8VP7P9dr2lcd.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10751], "popularity": 4.9175, "first_air_date": "1989-11-16", "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 13, "origin_country": ["GB"]}]}]}

Max meets Elizabeth; they live together, but when she talks of marriage, he balks. He becomes extremely jealous, probably without cause, and thinks she's taken up with a friend of his, Jack. Elizabeth, stung by Max's refusal to marry, catches Jack's eye, but the friendship seems innocent. Lena, who works with Max, likes him and realizes she can manipulate his jealousy and maybe engineer his split from Elizabeth. When she's sure Elizabeth is with a man, she calls Max at work, sending him home to confront the lovers. Then, Lena feels guilty and takes off for Max's apartment. What's really going on? Who's with Elizabeth?", "poster_path": "/nA3eMtLYyo0fjwvC3moqJzZZHRj.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10749], "popularity": 0.3707, "release_date": "1999-07-12", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 20}, {"backdrop_path": "/dSSnHdsrlkxVoKy6hzC2jYjaEmp.jpg", "id": 34574, "title": "Nadja", "original_title": "Nadja", "overview": "In a contemporary New York City, members of a dysfunctional family of vampires are trying to come to terms with each other, in the wake of their father's death.
