It was only loosely based on Maurice Leblancs novels.\n\nGeorges Descri\u00e8res' portrayal of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin showed more similarity to Graf Yoster than to Maurice Leblanc's original. He behaved in the first place as a perfect gentleman who never got angry. He was always relaxed, because whatever could possibly had bothered him in daily life was taken care of by his butler. It wasn't questioned how he had come to his financial independence although the series sometimes discreetly implied that he was a professional criminal. Besides rescuing damsels in distress Lupin took on criminals, competing with their wit and intelligence. Either he stole paintings from rich people who had to be considered white-collar criminals or he acted as a detective who derailed criminal schemes. However, when he was attacked, he could defend himself effortlessly by using elegant jujutsu methods.\n\nAmong the guest stars were German actors such as G\u00fcnter Strack and Sky du Mont.\n\nJean-Paul Salom\u00e9 said in his commentary on the DVD version of his film Ars\u00e8ne Lupin he had like this series as a child. German TV, one the investors, would broadcast the show eventually between 18:00-20:00 o'clock because it was only allowed to show commercials within that very timeslot. For them to get a financial return on investment the show had to be appropriate for families and also for children who would watch it alone. Subsequently it was nearby to ask to defuse and flatten some of Leblanc's plots in order to avoid possible complaints that could force the station to broadcast the show beyond the \"Vorabendprogramm\".", "poster_path": "/yQVkbqMT90Q2UFWS9XKtL03TuYb.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "fr", "genre_ids": [10759, 18], "popularity": 4.9939, "first_air_date": "1971-03-18", "vote_average": 7.7, "vote_count": 15, "origin_country": ["FR"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 586816, "title": "The Canterville Ghost", "original_title": "Das Gespenst von Canterville", "overview": "When an American family moves into a haunted mansion in England, the family's teenage daughter could be the key in fulfilling a prophecy and finally set the house's ghost free.", "poster_path": "/6aV9wWKYZeIdH5ZJ6SLXa5R0XIo.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "de", "genre_ids": [35, 14, 10770], "popularity": 0.0737, "release_date": "1965-05-25", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 1}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 353787, "title": "Gedankenketten", "original_title": "Gedankenketten", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "de", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 0.0608, "release_date": "1979-07-15", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}]}]}
