Al was the producer. He hired five directors and five art directors. Richard Bennett, one of our first early presidents of the Pewter Plough Corporation, was one of the directors and I was one of the art directors and, as soon as we were through televising one play, we had lunch and then met to plan next week\u2019s show. That was over 50 years ago, and I\u2019m trying to think; I believe the TV art director is his own set decorator \u2014yes, of course!
