It is set in the fictional Danish town of Korsb\u00e6k between 1929 and 1947. It follows the lives of a range of characters from across the social spectrum, focusing specifically on the rivalry between the families of two businessmen: The banker Hans Christian Varn\u00e6s, an established local worthy, and social climber Mads Skjern, who arrives in town as the series opens. The name Matador was taken from the localised edition of the boardgame Monopoly, also the series' tentative English title. In addition, in contemporary Danish a \"matador\" is often used to describe a business tycoon, in the series referring to the character of Mads Skjern and his craftiness as a self-made entrepreneur.\n\nDirected by famed Danish film maker Erik Balling, Matador was the idea of author Lise N\u00f8rgaard who wrote the bulk of the episodes alongside Karen Smith, Jens Louis Petersen and Paul Hammerich. The series is one of the most well-known and popular examples of Danish television and represents the peak of longtime development of Danish TV drama by the public service channel Danmarks Radio.\n\nThe series has become part of the modern self-understanding of Danes, partly because of its successful mix of melodrama and a distinct warm Danish humour in the depiction of characters, which were portrayed by a wide range of the most popular Danish actors at the time; but also not least because of its accurate portrayal of a turbulent Denmark from around the start of the Great Depression and through Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark in World War II.", "poster_path": "/aPAOnEESzuOHvCjPSveUfsiBPuP.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "da", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 80.2353, "first_air_date": "1978-11-11", "vote_average": 9.148, "vote_count": 27, "origin_country": ["DK"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 24620, "title": "Charly & Steffen", "original_title": "Charly & Steffen", "overview": "A sequel to \"Me and Charley\", it starts with Steffen's graduation from a secondary school in \u00c5rhus (Denmark), where he later that day bumps into Charly and their friendship continues while portraying life in \u00c5rhus 1979.", "poster_path": "/lehjpRZ2MRYFo4Hh6TdYG3F3wXU.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "da", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 0.1083, "release_date": "1979-12-21", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.9, "vote_count": 5}, {"backdrop_path": "/e9qcI1CeJJerARX3xZ3VpS9jzEr.jpg", "id": 197270, "title": "Katinka", "original_title": "Ved Vejen", "overview": "A new foreman, Huus, arrives in a sleepy Danish village, much to the delight of the unmarried women there.

An audience member is chosen as \"Secretary\" and has the job of keeping a note of the topics covered on a white board. In practice, the personality of the secretary will also prompt many jokes \u2014 usually at his or her expense. At the end of the show, Skinner asks either the secretary or the audience to choose between two song books, and to pick a page number between 1 and 20. This process determines which song is performed by the duo, sung by Skinner with Baddiel accompanying him on piano.\n\nTopics of discussion are wholly mandated by the audience and have ranged from discussions of the war against Iraq and other political events to comments on the latest plot twists of popular soap operas and the Atkins diet.
