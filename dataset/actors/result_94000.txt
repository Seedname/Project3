These people are both simple and sensitive, they have their own pleasures (e.g. Leli is a collector of cheap, but inutile things) and the greatest delight of all of them is a hunting. Crude poetics of amateur hunting is screened by dreamy pictures of this area. Menzel mixes sentimental lyricism and rough (but not vulgar!) humor and the outcome is the never-ending landscape of continuous life in the proximate nearness of nature. The performances of actors are brilliant. Both Rudolf Hrusinsky as a Franz and Jarom\u00edr Hanzlik as a Leli have nonrecurring charm bottomed on a pain and inebriation.

It was only loosely based on Maurice Leblancs novels.\n\nGeorges Descri\u00e8res' portrayal of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin showed more similarity to Graf Yoster than to Maurice Leblanc's original. He behaved in the first place as a perfect gentleman who never got angry. He was always relaxed, because whatever could possibly had bothered him in daily life was taken care of by his butler. It wasn't questioned how he had come to his financial independence although the series sometimes discreetly implied that he was a professional criminal. Besides rescuing damsels in distress Lupin took on criminals, competing with their wit and intelligence. Either he stole paintings from rich people who had to be considered white-collar criminals or he acted as a detective who derailed criminal schemes. However, when he was attacked, he could defend himself effortlessly by using elegant jujutsu methods.\n\nAmong the guest stars were German actors such as G\u00fcnter Strack and Sky du Mont.\n\nJean-Paul Salom\u00e9 said in his commentary on the DVD version of his film Ars\u00e8ne Lupin he had like this series as a child. German TV, one the investors, would broadcast the show eventually between 18:00-20:00 o'clock because it was only allowed to show commercials within that very timeslot. For them to get a financial return on investment the show had to be appropriate for families and also for children who would watch it alone. Subsequently it was nearby to ask to defuse and flatten some of Leblanc's plots in order to avoid possible complaints that could force the station to broadcast the show beyond the \"Vorabendprogramm\".", "poster_path": "/yQVkbqMT90Q2UFWS9XKtL03TuYb.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "fr", "genre_ids": [10759, 18], "popularity": 5.3695, "first_air_date": "1971-03-18", "vote_average": 7.7, "vote_count": 15, "origin_country": ["FR"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 594093, "title": "Les aventures d'une jeune veuve", "original_title": "Les aventures d'une jeune veuve", "overview": "A widow must cope with her late husband's associates, crooked Japanese businessmen who want her shares of a rich Northern Quebec land and a Jewish con man who wants to get a hand of her mysterious synthetic fur coat.", "poster_path": "/7JpKPxoRybDa57FoIV4wZ98jyjP.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "fr", "genre_ids": [35], "popularity": 0.0286, "release_date": "1974-12-25", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 2}, {"backdrop_path": "/wrLKhrmEeMY0npGUl4jj7fz4Dvq.jpg", "id": 10150, "name": "Lance et Compte", "original_name": "Lance et Compte", "overview": "Lance et Compte is a series of Quebec t\u00e9l\u00e9romans revolving around a Quebec City ice hockey team.

It followed a magazine format, combining political analysis and discussion with consumer affairs, light entertainment and sports reporting. It began on 9 September 1969, running between Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6.00pm, before being extended to five days a week in 1972. From 1976 until 1981 the start time was 5:55pm. The final edition was broadcast on 5 August 1983, and the following October it was replaced by Sixty Minutes. The long-running Watchdog programme began as a Nationwide feature.\n\nThe light entertainment was quite similar in tone to That's Life!. Eccentric stories featured skateboarding ducks and men who claimed that they could walk on egg shells..

Chapman and produced by Thames Television for ITV between 7 March 1984 and 23 October 1986. A ratings success at the time, the show is well remembered for its opening titles featuring a silhouette of a person in a rocking chair.\n\nIt stars Julia McKenzie and Anton Rodgers as Hester and William Fields, a devoted middle-class couple with an idyllic suburban lifestyle. William works while Hester keeps home. The crux of the show was that she was always looking to try new hobbies or find ways to improve her life, much of which exasperated her hard-working husband.\n\nThe family home had a granny flat attached, in which Hester's mother Nancy lived. She was divorced from Hester's father Guy although remarried him as the series progressed. The couple had a daughter called Emma who frequently telephoned but never appeared. Her husband Peter did appear often. They later had a son \u2014 the Fields' first grandchild \u2014 whom they named Guy, after his great-grandfather.\n\nPerhaps, the best remembered supporting character was Sonia Barrett who would frequently pop round to borrow items to replace hers due to breakage, theft or mislaying. Hester was not perturbed by this, as the two were close friends, but it used to irritate William. Sonia had the show's only catchphrase \u2014 she would always knock on the back door of the Fields' home and then say It's only Sonia! as she walked in. This would sometimes lead to applause of recognition from the studio audience, a phenomenon more regularly seen within American sitcoms. Sonia's husband John appeared on occasion, as did William's secretary Miss Denham, played by Daphne Oxenford.", "poster_path": "/yOdUjEw2kih4IAeB2GnGC1QLr4R.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35], "popularity": 2.4731, "first_air_date": "1984-03-07", "vote_average": 6.667, "vote_count": 9, "origin_country": ["GB"]}]}]}
