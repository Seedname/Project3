NBC asked Cooper to write the script for the premiere, \"First Person Singular\", which is told entirely from the point of view of an unseen murderer who kills his obnoxious wife and winds up being executed. Variety gave this first episode a rave review (\"undoubtedly one of the best dramatic shows yet seen on a television screen\"), but Lights Out did not become a regular NBC-TV series until 1949.", "poster_path": "/sUX5J7lS6FnCFvUOqXCYyQPp0f9.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [10765, 80, 18, 10764], "popularity": 26.3611, "first_air_date": "1949-07-19", "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 3, "origin_country": ["US"]}]}]}
