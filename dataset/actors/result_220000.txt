The series was filmed in Cornwall, with a production office in Truro. Music for the series was composed by Nigel Hess and was awarded the Royal Television Society award for the best television theme. Wycliffe is played by Jack Shepherd, assisted by DI Doug Kersey and DI Lucy Lane.\n\nEach episode deals with a murder investigation. In the early series, the stories are adapted from Burley's books and are in classic whodunit style, often with quirky characters and plot elements. In later seasons, the tone becomes more naturalistic and there is more emphasis on internal politics within the police.", "poster_path": "/c1oq4XHTCPF3hwV4F4ZzkQCMpXS.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [80, 18], "popularity": 15.503, "first_air_date": "1994-07-24", "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 3, "origin_country": ["GB"]}]}]}
