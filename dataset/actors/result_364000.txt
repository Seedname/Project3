The program, originally created by Robert \"Nick\" Nicholson and E. Roger Muir and produced by Chuck Barris, has appeared in many different versions since its 1966 debut. The show became famous for some of the arguments that couples had over incorrect answers in the form of mistaken predictions, and it even led to some divorces.\n\nMany of The Newlywed Game's questions dealt with \"making whoopee\", the euphemism that producers used for sexual intercourse to circumvent network censorship. However, it became such a catchphrase of the show that its founding host, Bob Eubanks, continued to use the word throughout the show's many runs, even in the 1980s and 1990s episodes and beyond, when he could easily have said \"make love\" or \"have sex\" without censorship.\n\nGSN's version of The Newlywed Game airs reruns throughout the week. Network Bounce TV has acquired the reruns from GSN.\n\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked it #10 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever.", "poster_path": "/okPYU0XGquBA3cpcnBBqDF5q8Oc.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 29.7676, "first_air_date": "1966-07-11", "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 5, "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"backdrop_path": "/6pXJh1G9Iuqc3WlWJnr7He9ESrz.jpg", "id": 1040, "name": "Let's Make a Deal", "original_name": "Let's Make a Deal", "overview": "Let's Make a Deal is a television game show which originated in the United States and has since been produced in many countries throughout the world.

Specifically, it was the first successful network variety series starring an African American. During its first two seasons, its Nielsen ratings made it the nation's second most watched show.\n\nThe show consisted of many skits over an hour. It also broke new ground in American television by using a 'Theatre-in-the-Round' stage format, with the audience seated on all sides of a circular performance area.\n\nWilson was most famous for creating the role of Geraldine Jones, a sassy, modern woman who had a boyfriend named Killer. Flip also created the role of Reverend Leroy, who was the minister of the Church of What's Happening Now!. New parishioners were wary of coming to the church as it was hinted that Reverend Leroy was a con artist. Wilson popularized such catchphrases as \"What you see is what you get\", and \"The devil made me do it!\".", "poster_path": "/4qUf7B8eBZKjwjhfgU63J9OvQsT.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35], "popularity": 7.0432, "first_air_date": "1970-09-17", "vote_average": 4.765, "vote_count": 17, "origin_country": ["US"]}]}]}

Unusually for ITV comedies of the time, there was no laughter track and the humour deliberately kept extremely dry, using convoluted wordplay and subtle commentary on popular culture. Brass is northern English slang for \"money\" as well as for \"effrontery\". The series also gleefully parodied the 1977 Granada TV dramatisation of Dickens' Hard Times, which also starred Timothy West.\n\nThe series, created by John Stevenson and Julian Roach, was set around two feuding families\u2014the wealthy Hardacres and the poor, working-class Fairchilds, who lived in a small terraced house rented from the Hardacre empire. The Hardacre family was headed by the ruthless self-made businessman Bradley, who espoused Thatcherite rhetoric while coming up with various harebrained schemes to make his businesses more efficient so he could sack workers, and his alcoholic aristocratic wife Lady Patience. The head of the Fairchilds was the stern \"Red\" Agnes, who spread militant socialist rhetoric around the Hardacre mine, mill and munitions factory, and her doltish, forelock-tugging husband George, who is dominated by his wife and his boss.
