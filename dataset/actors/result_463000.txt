The show aired Monday nights on TNT, going head-to-head with the World Wrestling Federation's Monday Night Raw from September 4, 1995 to March 26, 2001. Production ceased shortly after WCW was purchased by the WWF.\n\nThe debut of Nitro began the Monday Night Wars, a ratings battle between the WWF and WCW that lasted for almost six years and saw each company resort to cutthroat tactics to try to compete with the competition. In mid-1996, Nitro began to draw better ratings than Raw based on the strength of the nWo storyline, an anarchist wrestling stable that wanted to take over WCW. Nitro continued to beat Raw for 84 consecutive weeks, forcing WWE owner Vince McMahon to change the way he did business. As the nWo storyline grew stagnant, fan interest in the storyline waned, and Raw began to edge out Nitro in the ratings.\n\nThe turning point for the organizations came during the January 4, 1999 broadcast of Nitro, during which lead commentator Tony Schiavone gave away the results of matches for that night's Raw broadcast. As Raw was taped and Nitro was live, Bischoff believed that knowing the outcome would dissuade viewers from watching the program. Excited by the prospect of seeing perennial WWF underdog Mick Foley win the WWF Championship, a large number of Nitro viewers changed channels to watch Raw, switching back to Nitro after Foley won the title. From that week forward, Raw beat Nitro in the ratings by a significant amount, and WCW was never able to regain the success it once had.", "poster_path": "/4wxkWyoqOqaRgSwQiPOAXdF5FNL.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [10759, 18], "popularity": 9.9001, "first_air_date": "1995-09-04", "vote_average": 8.4, "vote_count": 32, "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 398155, "title": "ECW Hardcore Heaven 1996", "original_title": "ECW Hardcore Heaven 1996", "overview": "Date: 1996, June 22  Location: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Attendance: 1,250  Mikey Whipwreck vs. Shane Douglas  The Dudleys (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and Big Dick Dudley) vs. The Full Blooded Italians (JT Smith and Little Guido)  Paul Varelans vs. Taz  ECW World Heavyweight Championship Match  Raven (c) vs. Terry Gordy  ECW World Tag Team Championship Match  The Eliminators (Saturn and Kronus) (c) vs. The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustapha Saed)  Axl Rotten and Hack Myers vs. The Samoan Gangsta Party (Samu and Matty Smalls)  ECW World Television Championship Match  Chris Jericho vs. Pitbull #2 (c)  Weapons Match  Brian Lee vs. Tommy Dreamer  Rob Van Dam vs. Sabu", "poster_path": "/qUr2julETFzWpriQwalLMj2fI5K.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.2359, "release_date": "1996-06-22", "video": true, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 1}]}]}
