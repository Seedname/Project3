It centres on Angelo, an alien who came from another world during the first series; the portal from his world being that of a wardrobe in one of the bedrooms. He lives with Mike King, and Mike's mother Rita. Later series had Mike and Rita move away, with Rita's nephew Mike Mason staying on in the house with housekeeper Katy. Together, Mike and Angelo get up to all kinds of crazy adventures - all within the vicinity of the house that they live in. Angelo is always inventing something crazy, or walking on the ceiling, or summoning up historical figures from the past. They always wreak havoc together, much to Katy's annoyance, crying \"ANGELO!!\" in her Scottish accent constantly or Rita in her Canadian accent before her. Their neighbours are the posh Fawkes-Bentleys, in whose house some of the show's scenes are occasionally based.\n\nThe 1999 series began with Angelo and Katy reading a postcard explaining that Mike was having a good time in America. In his place, Daphne Fawkes-Bentley's niece Michaela became Angelo's sidekick. For the final series, Katy's nephew, also called Mike, joined. The final series was shown in 2000.", "poster_path": "/3U1Qk6LH530NkSm9SIEyz3Wr9g9.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10751, 10765], "popularity": 13.9758, "first_air_date": "1989-03-16", "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 3, "origin_country": ["GB"]}]}]}
