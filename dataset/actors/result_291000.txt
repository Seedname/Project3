Other prominent families featured on the soap were the rival Lockridge family, and the more modest Andrade and Perkins families.\n\nSanta Barbara aired in over 40 countries around the world and is best remembered for its witty dialogue and sometimes tongue-in-cheek situations that often seemed like an affectionate parody of the genre.

It differed in some respects nonetheless. While Tales sometimes dabbled in stories of science fiction and fantasy, this series was more strictly horror. As the name implies, each episode of Monsters featured a different monster which the story concerned, from the animatronic puppet of a fictional children's television program to mutated, weapon-wielding lab rats.\n\nSimilar to Tales, however, the stories in Monsters were rarely very straightforward action plots and often contained some ironic twist in which a character's conceit or greed would do him in, often with gruesome results. Adding to this was a sense of comedy often lost on horror productions which might in some instances lighten the audience's mood but in many cases added to the overall eeriness of the production.", "poster_path": "/fnBz19xGCKc7mfEo9NOeRWIe4iX.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [9648, 10765, 18], "popularity": 9.6596, "first_air_date": "1988-10-22", "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 21, "origin_country": ["US"]}]}]}
