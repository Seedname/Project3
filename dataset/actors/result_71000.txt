Brinkmann's life outside of the public eye was every bit as turbulent as his public image, though in different ways -- he had a stormy relationship with his wife and their son was severely handicapped. Filmmaker Harald Bergmann wrote and directed Brinkmanns Zorn (aka Brinkmann's Wrath), a biographical drama which stars Eckhard Rhode as Brinkmann and Alexandra Finder as his spouse. Brinkmanns Zorn was screened in competition at the 2007 Rotterdam International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster_path": "/ecPDXVF8FjfiXGC9RN0Va4cF1nO.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.0546, "release_date": "2007-01-11", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 4}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 493048, "title": "Der Schmetterlingsj\u00e4ger", "original_title": "Der Schmetterlingsj\u00e4ger", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "de", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 0.0977, "release_date": "2014-07-17", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 566410, "title": "Schaut euch diesen Berg an \u2013 einstmals war er Feuer", "original_title": "Schaut euch diesen Berg an \u2013 einstmals war er Feuer", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "de", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.0071, "release_date": "1991-03-01", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}]}]}
