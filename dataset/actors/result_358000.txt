Widowed and with three children, she is forced to fight for her family and leaves for the paradisiacal beach town of Maramores, where her mother Zoroastra lives. Parallel to the difficulties, L\u00edvia discovers that she is involved in the eternal struggle of Good against Evil.\n\nIn fact, L\u00edvia is the reincarnation of Princess Cec\u00edlia, the eternal passion of the vampire B\u00f3ris Vladescu, who has been pursuing her for centuries. The two met in 7th century Europe, when B\u00f3ris disputed the princess's love with Count Rog\u00e9rio. Nowadays, Rog\u00e9rio was Beto, L\u00edvia's husband, and the two times he faced Boris, his arch-enemy, he took the worst.\n\nBoris is in Maramores to get Cecilia, his immortal beloved. Or rather, Livia, who raises the boy Zeca, who she doesn't even suspect is actually a half-vampire, son of Boris. The vampire is willing to prepare his son to take his place, but Zeca is reluctant to accept his condition, much to his father's despair.\n\nWith B\u00f3ris comes a legion of vampires willing to terrorize the residents of the peaceful city. Among them, the splendid Mina, his wife, and the gallant Victor, who involves the sweet Ci\u00e7a in a game of seduction. Vampires are closely watched by the flustered Galileo Van Burger, a vampire hunter who failed to prevent his wacky son Bart\u00f4 from being bitten.\n\nWho also keeps an eye on the vampires is the mystical Zoroastra, mother of L\u00edvia, a modern witch, who owns the main inn in Maramores. And the mysterious Ezekiel, in reality an angel who came down to Earth to protect L\u00edvia and Zeca from the evil that persecutes them.\n\nEngineer Rodrigo also arrives in the city, followed by his ex-girlfriend Lara. The two are the first victims of vampires. Lara is bitten by Victor and becomes an evil vampire, due to her bad temper. Rodrigo is bitten by Mina, who becomes pregnant and is expecting a daughter from him, which she says is from Boris.\n\nMeanwhile, Rodrigo is used by Boris to approach L\u00edvia. Who does not like this involvement is Augusto, a friend of L\u00edvia who has loved her in the past. Augusto is a widower who raises his small children with the help of sister-in-law Marta, a blind woman, but bitter and Machiavellian, who does everything to keep him from L\u00edvia, because she loves him.", "poster_path": "/fQsnoRyA9Fd0Zw6AUldw4sxrYyR.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "pt", "genre_ids": [10766, 10765, 18], "popularity": 52.5325, "first_air_date": "2002-08-26", "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 11, "origin_country": ["BR"]}, {"backdrop_path": "/dtZ6OupwiYYZHgp2jGvAQFoIgBk.jpg", "id": 64284, "name": "The Illusionist", "original_name": "O Astro", "overview": "The illusionist is mysterious, captivating and mesmerizes all those around him.

The name Matador was taken from the localised edition of the boardgame Monopoly, also the series' tentative English title. In addition, in contemporary Danish a \"matador\" is often used to describe a business tycoon, in the series referring to the character of Mads Skjern and his craftiness as a self-made entrepreneur.\n\nDirected by famed Danish film maker Erik Balling, Matador was the idea of author Lise N\u00f8rgaard who wrote the bulk of the episodes alongside Karen Smith, Jens Louis Petersen and Paul Hammerich. The series is one of the most well-known and popular examples of Danish television and represents the peak of longtime development of Danish TV drama by the public service channel Danmarks Radio.\n\nThe series has become part of the modern self-understanding of Danes, partly because of its successful mix of melodrama and a distinct warm Danish humour in the depiction of characters, which were portrayed by a wide range of the most popular Danish actors at the time; but also not least because of its accurate portrayal of a turbulent Denmark from around the start of the Great Depression and through Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark in World War II.", "poster_path": "/aPAOnEESzuOHvCjPSveUfsiBPuP.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "da", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 80.2353, "first_air_date": "1978-11-11", "vote_average": 9.148, "vote_count": 27, "origin_country": ["DK"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 335585, "title": "Midtimellem", "original_title": "Midtimellem", "overview": "The film takes place over a day for two young people's lives.

It is set in the fictional Danish town of Korsb\u00e6k between 1929 and 1947. It follows the lives of a range of characters from across the social spectrum, focusing specifically on the rivalry between the families of two businessmen: The banker Hans Christian Varn\u00e6s, an established local worthy, and social climber Mads Skjern, who arrives in town as the series opens. The name Matador was taken from the localised edition of the boardgame Monopoly, also the series' tentative English title. In addition, in contemporary Danish a \"matador\" is often used to describe a business tycoon, in the series referring to the character of Mads Skjern and his craftiness as a self-made entrepreneur.\n\nDirected by famed Danish film maker Erik Balling, Matador was the idea of author Lise N\u00f8rgaard who wrote the bulk of the episodes alongside Karen Smith, Jens Louis Petersen and Paul Hammerich. The series is one of the most well-known and popular examples of Danish television and represents the peak of longtime development of Danish TV drama by the public service channel Danmarks Radio.\n\nThe series has become part of the modern self-understanding of Danes, partly because of its successful mix of melodrama and a distinct warm Danish humour in the depiction of characters, which were portrayed by a wide range of the most popular Danish actors at the time; but also not least because of its accurate portrayal of a turbulent Denmark from around the start of the Great Depression and through Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark in World War II.", "poster_path": "/aPAOnEESzuOHvCjPSveUfsiBPuP.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "da", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 80.2353, "first_air_date": "1978-11-11", "vote_average": 9.148, "vote_count": 27, "origin_country": ["DK"]}]}]}
