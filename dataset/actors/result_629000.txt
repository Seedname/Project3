(Czech: Pro\u010d?) is a 1987 Czechoslovak drama film directed by Karel Smyczek. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. The film deals with the hooliganism in Czechoslovakia, particularly with the fans of football club Sparta from Prague, whose supporters were the pioneers of the football fan riots in Czechoslovakia, starting with hooligan actions already in the 1960s, like breaking the trains in which they travelled when they went on Sparta's away games. The film deals with one of such episodes", "poster_path": "/5DQ8Wa0Mo1u9fRbK0jwCvwusz1T.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "cs", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 0.3537, "release_date": "1987-10-01", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 16}]}]}
