As the name implies, each episode of Monsters featured a different monster which the story concerned, from the animatronic puppet of a fictional children's television program to mutated, weapon-wielding lab rats.\n\nSimilar to Tales, however, the stories in Monsters were rarely very straightforward action plots and often contained some ironic twist in which a character's conceit or greed would do him in, often with gruesome results. Adding to this was a sense of comedy often lost on horror productions which might in some instances lighten the audience's mood but in many cases added to the overall eeriness of the production.", "poster_path": "/fnBz19xGCKc7mfEo9NOeRWIe4iX.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [9648, 10765, 18], "popularity": 9.6596, "first_air_date": "1988-10-22", "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 21, "origin_country": ["US"]}]}]}
