The series focused on several families and teenagers in a coastal community, and a key on-going storyline concerned renewed interest in a long-unsolved local murder mystery.\n\nEcho Point originally aired at 7:00pm weeknights to low ratings and the series was cancelled after a little over 100 episodes had been produced. The final episodes were aired in a late night 11.30pm slot. The only purchaser of the series in the UK was Central Television, the only member of the ITV network to screen it. Central screened the series at 1315-1345 in the summer of 1998 following the conclusion of A Country Practice.
