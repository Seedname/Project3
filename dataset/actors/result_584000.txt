Artists including Devendra Banhart, Katie Melua, and Ayo made their French TV debut on the show. The show's chief lighting technician, Jean-Philippe Bourdon, was awarded two Sept d'or in 1994 and 1995.\n\nThe show featured unique duets and highlights new artists and uses different presenters for each episode. These aspects, and the general emphasis on original music, led the Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel to identify Taratata as a uniquely creative show on French TV in April 2009.\n\nThe show aired throughout Europe on TV5MONDE Europe on Saturday nights. The show is also franchised to Dubai Television in Arabic with an almost identical format to its French counterpart.\n\nOn 31 May 2013, France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions announced that the show was cancelled. Despite the announcement, the show will continue in a web only format and that a concert will be oragnized at Z\u00e9nith de Paris on 10 October 2013. The last show was recorded on 13 June 2013 and was broadcast on 12 July 2013.", "poster_path": "/eHBWAHqMBlnjGTxHoPz3XXmi6QF.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "fr", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 8.6171, "first_air_date": "1993-01-10", "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 4, "origin_country": ["FR"]}]}]}
