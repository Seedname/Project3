First broadcast on ATV Midlands from September 1967 to May 1968, it has since been transmitted in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Characters are presented as marionette puppets alongside scale model sets and special effects in a filming technique that the Andersons termed \"Supermarionation\". This technology incorporated solenoid motors as a means of synchronising the puppet's lip movements with pre-recorded dialogue.\n\nSet in 2068, Captain Scarlet presents the hostilities between Earth and a race of Martians known as the Mysterons. After human astronauts attack their city on Mars, the vengeful Mysterons declare war on Earth, initiating a series of reprisals that are countered by Spectrum, a worldwide security organisation. Spectrum boasts the extraordinary abilities of its primary agent, Captain Scarlet. During the events of the pilot episode, Scarlet acquires the Mysteron healing power of \"retro-metabolism\" and is thereafter considered to be virtually \"indestructible\", being able to recover fully from injuries that would normally be fatal.", "poster_path": "/83Q8UHBJYLQx4bbCDYvt3TxODd1.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [10759, 16, 10765], "popularity": 8.0697, "first_air_date": "1967-09-29", "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 26, "origin_country": ["GB"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 264079, "title": "Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars", "original_title": "Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars", "overview": "A compilation of four episodes from the Supermarionation series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.

In the world of rock climbing, there is only one name -- John Bachar. Controversial and uncompromising, Bachar pushed the boundaries of what was possible and raised the world's standards at a time when climbers merely pursued the physical in climbing. A true rock star, he soloed 5.11 when 5.12 didn't exist, created the first 5.12 in Yosemite Valley, bouldered harder, climbed stronger, and refused to compromise his ethics along the way. Then, at the height of his fame, he disappeared. This is his story.  This is the latest climbing DVD release from director/producer Michael Reardon. This is a first hand account of John Bachar and his free soloing (no rope) mastery during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Featuring interviews with Royal Robbins, Peter Croft, John Long and John Gill, the film contains footage of Bachar soloing some of the hardest climbs of their time in Germany, Spain, and his home stomping grounds of Yosemite Valley.", "poster_path": "/3Qi65OqTa3UtFPdaPy4XHomCyQ8.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [99], "popularity": 0.1494, "release_date": "2005-01-01", "video": true, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1}, {"backdrop_path": "/nvSKOATWuqhUCwaT966aOUjD2ua.jpg", "id": 1050884, "title": "Joshua Tree: Climb On!
