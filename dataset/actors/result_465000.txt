Like many other shows of its genre, such as American Bandstand, Solid Gold featured musical performances and various other elements such as music videos. What set Solid Gold apart was a group of dancers in revealing costumes who at various points in the program performed various dances to the top ten hits of the week. Many other specials aired in which the dancers would dance to older pop hits as well. Reviews of the show were not always positive, with The New York Times referring to it as \"the pop music show that is its own parody...[enacting] mini-dramas...of covetousness, lust and aerobic toning--routines that typically have a minimal connection with the songs that back them up.\"\n\nThe series ran until July 23, 1988, and it was usually transmitted on Saturdays in the early evening. In 1986, Solid Gold added the current year to its title, so in the seventh season the show was known as Solid Gold '86/'87. For the eighth and last season the program became known as Solid Gold In Concert, reflecting the addition of more live performances than had previously been featured on the program in the past.", "poster_path": "/xDbUCjOV5sn81SS95uz7ob4vqxy.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 10.8047, "first_air_date": "1980-09-13", "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 3, "origin_country": ["US"]}]}]}
