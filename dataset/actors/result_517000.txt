A strong, almost incestuous affection develops between the teenagers, resulting in twins who are given to a foster family. Also standing in the way of love is Spyros, determined to take his foster daughter as his wife. The lovers then decide to flee the village, persecuted by their father, leading a life of exile. As Alexis joins a group of musicians planning to go to the United States, Eleni regains custody of the twins. Angelopoulos, as in previous films, looks at the sacrifice of civilians confronted by the workers' demonstrations of 1935, the rule of Metaxas' fascist junta and forced emigration to America, and finally the civil war of 1944-1949.", "poster_path": "/gLH8vr0XTN4xhwz5iMhBxyw9frI.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "el", "genre_ids": [18, 36], "popularity": 0.7423, "release_date": "2004-02-20", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 94}]}]}
