The series was broadcast by the Nine Network, initially as two one-hour episodes each week.\n\nPrincipal cast members included John Sheerin and Brenda Addie as Dan and Barbara Taylor, Jeremy Sims as their mischievous son Alex, Deborah Kennedy as Dan's sister Connie Reynolds, Tim Robertson as Dan's brother Jack, Anne Grigg as his wife Sarah, and Michael Caton as neighbourhood friend Bill Anderson. Originally, creator Lynn Bayonas pitched the show as a family-oriented drama; however to help ensure the program's success, Channel Nine asked for nude scenes and risqu\u00e9 elements to also be included in the series. Initial publicity for the show focused on the sex angle, and it was for this that Chances was chiefly known.", "poster_path": "/jk2LlMT4SRBQ9lg7kC9UeBhYmVf.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [10766, 18], "popularity": 12.4005, "first_air_date": "1991-01-29", "vote_average": 3.0, "vote_count": 2, "origin_country": ["AU"]}]}]}

The show featured three contestants who competed to answer general knowledge questions in order to win the grand prize of $5,000 from the show's host, Ben Stein. In the second half of each episode, Stein participated as a \"common contestant\" in order to defend his money from being taken by his competitors. The show won five Daytime Emmy awards, with Stein and Jimmy Kimmel, the show's original co-host, sharing the Outstanding Game Show Host award in 1999.\n\nAs noted in a disclaimer during the closing credits, prize money won by contestants was paid from a prize budget furnished by the producers of the show. Any money left over in that budget at the end of a season was given to Stein. If the total amount paid out during a season exceeded that budget, the production company paid the excess, so Stein was never at risk of losing money from his own pocket.\n\nStein's co-host was Jimmy Kimmel for the first three years. Kimmel left in 2000 and was replaced by Nancy Pimental, who co-hosted the program through 2001. Kimmel's cousin, Sal Iacono, who took over the role in 2002, was the show's last co-host. Although Jimmy Kimmel left the program in 2000, he occasionally made guest appearances afterward, and hosted College Week episodes in 2001.", "poster_path": "/nch1cxYkTwwjHuZ1UwFMa6CssLe.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35], "popularity": 1.0007, "first_air_date": "1997-07-28", "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 11, "origin_country": ["US"]}]}]}

The show has had very high ratings of up to 1.8 million viewers during the last season.\n\nEvery year the VRT organises the Flikkendag, a family day where the public can meet the actors of the show.

Norriss and Fegen wrote the first five series, after which they left the show.\n\nThe Brittas Empire enjoyed a long and successful run throughout the 1990s, and gained itself large mainstream audiences. In 2004 the show came 47th on the BBC's Britain's Best Sitcom poll, and all series have been released on DVD.\n\nThe creators Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen often combine farce with either surreal or dramatic elements in episodes. For example in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to become electrocuted.
