The director had the author's assistance going so far as working together, like mother and daughter, to work on the best-seller Catherine. Two years of preparation, fifteen months of shooting, two hundred actors - over fifteen hundred costumes. The episodes were not to be seen in prime time - but from 13:30 - 14:00 each afternoon. The production was nevertheless a huge success. The readers of the books were more than satisfied with what Marion Sarraut had done to Catherine. To their great joy, the producers had adapted the seven books more or less truthfully. Some minor changes had to be made, probably also because of the small bugdet they had at their disposal. Claudine Ancelot was a perfect Catherine. At her side, Pierre-Marie Escourrou as her great love Arnaud de Montsalvy. Pascale Petit was Sara, Beno\u00eet Brione was the evil Gilles de Rais, and Genevi\u00e8ve Casile Queen Yolande.\n\nFor over two decades, the story of \"Catherine and Arnaud\" had vanished.
