Set on the Grand Pine Indian Reservation, aka \u201cReservation X\u201d, HONEY MOCCASIN combines elements of melodrama, performance art, cable access, and \u2018whodunit\u2019 to question conventions of ethnic and sexual identity as well as film narrative. A comedy/thriller complete with a fashion show and torchy musical numbers, this witty film employs a surreal pastiche of styles to depict the rivalry between bars The Smokin\u2019 Moccasin and The Inukshuk Cafe, the saga of closeted drag queen/powwow clothing thief Zachary John, and the travails of crusading investigator Honey Moccasin. This irreverent reappropriation of familiar narrative strategies serves as a provocative spring-board for an investigation of authenticity, cultural identity, and the articulation of modern Native American experience in cinematic language and pop culture.", "poster_path": "/vO4rVIoLpQH4UOGh4YLlhviInkc.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 9648], "popularity": 0.0655, "release_date": "1998-01-01", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 1}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 606159, "title": "Skin Deep", "original_title": "Skin Deep", "overview": "A filmmaker initiates a dangerous and threatening game when a woman responds to her ad in a tattoo magazine.", "poster_path": "/hdvVgdiwNSdckqmEFTZVJ2tpXG6.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [53], "popularity": 0.1978, "release_date": "1995-06-13", "video": false, "vote_average": 1.0, "vote_count": 1}]}]}
