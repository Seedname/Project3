My parents did not know how to cope with the loss of their child and the entire family experienced indescribable pain. Phantom Limb uses this personal story as a point of departure. Whether it is a loss through death or divorce, the stages of grieving are the same. Individuals often go through denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, ultimately, some kind of acceptance, in order to heal. The film is loosely structured according to these stages. Interspersed throughout this poetic documentary are interviews with a cemetery owner, a phantom limb patient and an author of a book about evidence for life after death. Phantom Limb reminds viewers that while grief is painful and isolating, it is a reminder to each of us that life is impermanent. - Jay Rosenblatt", "poster_path": "/9DB6jrL253mSj83ppJjvFOhMFfi.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [99], "popularity": 0.0619, "release_date": "2005-04-21", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 12}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 292547, "title": "The Young and the Dead", "original_title": "The Young and the Dead", "overview": "Historical Documentary from directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini about the Hollywood Memorial Park cemetery.", "poster_path": "/2eILTBBDu8nFdHalHzTxrh9p3oA.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [99], "popularity": 0.0327, "release_date": "2000-04-22", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 329525, "title": "Hollywood Ghosts & Gravesites", "original_title": "Hollywood Ghosts & Gravesites", "overview": "Ever wonder if celebrity truly dies with the celebrity, if graves really can give up the dead, or if walls really do talk?
