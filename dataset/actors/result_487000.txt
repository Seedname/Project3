It began in 1989 on BBC One and ran for four series, with the last episode shown in 1994. The show was a partially musical comic retelling of the legend of Robin Hood, placing Maid Marian in the role of leader of the Merry Men, and reducing Robin to an incompetent ex-tailor.\n\nThe programme was much appreciated by children and adults alike, and has been likened to Blackadder, not only for its historical setting and the presence of Tony Robinson, but also for its comic style. It is more surreal than Blackadder, however, and drops even more anachronisms. Many of the show's cast such as Howard Lew Lewis, Forbes Collins, Ramsay Gilderdale and Patsy Byrne had previously appeared in various episodes of Blackadder alongside Robinson. Like many British children's programmes, there is a lot of social commentary sneakily inserted, as well as witty asides about the Royal family, buses running on time, etc. Many of the plots spoofed or referenced film and television shows including other incarnations of Robin Hood in those mediums.", "poster_path": "/6baSwjPEaMn7egL8VP7P9dr2lcd.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10751], "popularity": 4.9175, "first_air_date": "1989-11-16", "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 13, "origin_country": ["GB"]}, {"backdrop_path": "/jB3CQHS4zBzD00yZG936WmsH6P4.jpg", "id": 790, "name": "Agatha Christie's Poirot", "original_name": "Agatha Christie's Poirot", "overview": "From England to Egypt, accompanied by his elegant and trustworthy sidekicks, the intelligent yet eccentrically-refined Belgian detective Hercule Poirot pits his wits against a collection of first class deceptions.", "poster_path": "/6f4IVfbn8knb7RjdZlGLuW5guDc.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [80, 18, 9648], "popularity": 56.6768, "first_air_date": "1989-01-08", "vote_average": 8.144, "vote_count": 492, "origin_country": ["GB"]}, {"backdrop_path": "/pnyulr7wX1vEfyzScMRDAdxCwMc.jpg", "id": 2211, "name": "'Allo 'Allo!", "original_name": "'Allo 'Allo!", "overview": "The misadventures of hapless cafe owner Ren\u00e9 Artois and his escapades with the Resistance in occupied France.", "poster_path": "/m42lb4UxkpaFil4bw0bqqjlWCY4.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10768], "popularity": 21.103, "first_air_date": "1984-09-07", "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 227, "origin_country": ["GB"]}]}]}

Andy Griffith portrays the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. His life is complicated by an inept, but well-meaning deputy, Barney Fife, a spinster aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee, and a precocious young son, Opie. Local ne'er-do-wells, bumbling pals, and temperamental girlfriends further complicate his life. Andy Griffith stated in a Today Show interview, with respect to the time period of the show: \"Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was when we were doing it, of a time gone by.\"\n\nThe series never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and ended its final season at number one. It has been ranked by TV Guide as the 9th-best show in American television history. Though neither Griffith nor the show won awards during its eight-season run, series co-stars Knotts and Bavier accumulated a combined total of six Emmy Awards. The show, a semi-spin-off from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\", spawned its own spin-off series, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., a sequel series, Mayberry R.F.D., and a reunion telemovie, Return to Mayberry. The show's enduring popularity has generated a good deal of show-related merchandise. Reruns currently air on TV Land, and the complete series is available on DVD. All eight seasons are also now available by streaming video services such as Netflix.", "poster_path": "/smOam7qXPnqlfDlMx4I0UxK5ULB.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10751], "popularity": 31.212, "first_air_date": "1960-10-03", "vote_average": 7.594, "vote_count": 149, "origin_country": ["US"]}]}]}
