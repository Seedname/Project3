The morning showing was transferred to BBC1 in September 1983 when BBC Schools programming transferred to BBC2. It remained in that slot even after daytime television was launched in October 1986 and continued to be broadcast at that time until it was superseded in October 1988 by Playbus, which soon became Playdays.\n\nWhen the BBC scrapped the afternoon edition of Play School in September 1985, to make way for a variety of children's programmes in the afternoon, a Sunday morning compilation was launched called Hello Again!.\n\nThere were several opening sequences for Play School during its run, the first being \"Here's a house, here's a door. Windows: 1 2 3 4, ready to knock? Turn the lock - It's Play School.\" This changed in the early seventies to \"A house, with a door, 1 2 3 4, ready to play, what's the day?
