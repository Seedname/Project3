The show ran for three series before being cancelled, but is still generally remembered as \"some of the most mockable British television ever produced\". The scripts involved clich\u00e9d relationships and stilted dialogue, making the show the butt of several jokes - particularly on Terry Wogan's morning Radio 2 programme - which caused some embarrassment to the BBC.\n\nIn 1992, the BBC screened TV Hell, an evening of programming devoted to the worst television had to offer, and the first episode of Triangle was broadcast as part of the line-up.\n\nThe ferry used in the first series was the Tor Line's MS Tor Scandinavia.
