The series was preceded by Beast Wars, and was followed by Beast Wars Neo.\n\nThe series has a much lighter tone and is aimed more towards children, whereas the more accessible Beast Wars was intended for a wider age range. The series also uses conventional animation rather than CGI like Beast Wars: Transformers. With the exceptions of the faction leaders, all of the characters within the series are either re-molds or re-colors of earlier Beast Wars figures or Generation 2/Machine Wars figures.\n\nIn addition to the 43 episodes, there is also a 50-minute movie, Beast Wars II: Lio Convoy's Close Call!, which takes place sometime between episodes 32 and 38.", "poster_path": "/3Pj9UHvf5qvKDLzgZ2ekVkqIQp7.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "ja", "genre_ids": [16], "popularity": 4.1031, "first_air_date": "1998-04-01", "vote_average": 8.667, "vote_count": 3, "origin_country": ["JP"]}]}]}
