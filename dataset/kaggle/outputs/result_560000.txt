Norma Percy won the 1996 BAFTA TV Award for 'Best Factual Series' for the documentary. However, it has been argued that it presents a potentially slightly biased point-of-view; for instance during the trial of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 before the ICTY in The Hague, Judge Bonomy called the nature of much of the commentary \"tendentious\" (partisan).", "poster_path": "/pPnXvse3vL1dvCOiksZbnGFD3aR.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [99, 10768], "popularity": 1.3012, "first_air_date": "1995-09-03", "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 17, "origin_country": ["GB"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 269393, "title": "The Death of Yugoslavia", "original_title": "The Death of Yugoslavia", "overview": "History of the political events and the wars which broke the former state of Yugoslavia into several nations and caused an international political and humanitarian crisis.
