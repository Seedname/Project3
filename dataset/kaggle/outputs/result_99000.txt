BBC Radio 1 weathergirl Dianne Oxberry joined for the second series, which began on 28 April 1991.\n\nThe format was very similar to Going Live!, with imported cartoons punctuating items, such as games, music performances and interviews. A regular segment was The Wetter The Better, a game show based in a swimming pool and hosted by Ross King. A weekly drama was shown, in which the short episode ended in a dilemma of some sort. Two endings had been filmed and viewers telephoned to vote which ending would be shown.\n\nIt also incorporated a repeat run of Rentaghost, though all the pre-1980 episodes were omitted and the end-credits rarely seen. Later, episodes of Grandad, starring Clive Dunn, were also shown.\n\nThe theme tune was by Inspiral Carpets: a rewrite of their single \"Find Out Why\".

A young teacher comes to a remote village ,  which rich gentlemen have chosen as their hunting ground. The residents are happy and nice to each other.  Any dissatisfaction that arises is wiped away with freely available drugs or with the clubs of the village police. A gamekeeper  who makes sure that the high lords' hunting parties are not endangered becomes the new teacher in the village's first friend.
