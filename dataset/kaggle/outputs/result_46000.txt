Each night the public are invited to vote for the contestant they would like to stay in the show. At the end of the show one of the contestants must \"check out\". The presenters tell each of the contestants individually if they are \"safe\" and if so are ordered \"back to work\". The three remaining contestants are then marched into the Oliver Plunkett Suite to face the judges, one of whom sends one of the contestants back to work before all three cast their votes on which of the remaining two must leave the show. The evicted celebrity is then interviewed by the presenters, with best bits shown as well.
