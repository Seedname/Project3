Andy Griffith portrays the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. His life is complicated by an inept, but well-meaning deputy, Barney Fife, a spinster aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee, and a precocious young son, Opie. Local ne'er-do-wells, bumbling pals, and temperamental girlfriends further complicate his life. Andy Griffith stated in a Today Show interview, with respect to the time period of the show: \"Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was when we were doing it, of a time gone by.\"\n\nThe series never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and ended its final season at number one. It has been ranked by TV Guide as the 9th-best show in American television history. Though neither Griffith nor the show won awards during its eight-season run, series co-stars Knotts and Bavier accumulated a combined total of six Emmy Awards. The show, a semi-spin-off from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\", spawned its own spin-off series, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., a sequel series, Mayberry R.F.D., and a reunion telemovie, Return to Mayberry. The show's enduring popularity has generated a good deal of show-related merchandise. Reruns currently air on TV Land, and the complete series is available on DVD. All eight seasons are also now available by streaming video services such as Netflix.", "poster_path": "/smOam7qXPnqlfDlMx4I0UxK5ULB.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10751], "popularity": 31.212, "first_air_date": "1960-10-03", "vote_average": 7.594, "vote_count": 149, "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"backdrop_path": "/6pVkaevNOQB6OGnq8jH0AhnX5ct.jpg", "id": 657148, "title": "Live in Front of a Studio Audience: \"All in the Family\" and \"Good Times\"", "original_title": "Live in Front of a Studio Audience: \"All in the Family\" and \"Good Times\"", "overview": "Live performances of classic holiday-themed episodes from Norman Lear's hit shows \"All in the Family\" and \"Good Times.\"", "poster_path": "/eT6LvwBNOoj1GJntUoSOPCAWFJT.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10770, 10751], "popularity": 0.5961, "release_date": "2019-12-18", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 13}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 336176, "title": "The Facts of Life Goes to Paris", "original_title": "The Facts of Life Goes to Paris", "overview": "Mrs. Garrett and the girls travel to Paris, France.

On 8 May 2009, it was announced that Skavlan had been renewed for a second season. It was also announced that the show would no longer only be produced by SVT in Sweden; Skavlan would now be partly produced in Norway by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. The first twelve episodes of Skavlan's second season were produced by SVT in Sweden, and the remaining twelve by NRK in Norway.\n\nSkavlan speaks Norwegian and his dialog is therefore subtitled in Swedish in Sweden, even though the two languages are quite similar and mutually intelligible. If the persons being interviewed by Skavlan are Swedish, he often tells them to let him know if they do not understand what he is saying. Swedish novelist Jan Guillou has criticized SVT for subtitling the program, stating \"there is no need for that.

In 2003, composer Eric Robertson as well as David Greene and Mike Batt were nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Original Music Score for a Dramatic Series for their work on the show.\n\nSome episodes from the adaptation were released on VHS and later, DVD.

The show was produced in 1962 by husband and wife team Gerry and Sylvia Anderson through their company APF, in association with ATV for ITC Entertainment. While developing his new show, Anderson thought a brand of motor oil\u2014Castrol XL\u2014had an interesting sound. A phonetic change created the name \"Fireball XL\", with the \"-5\" added as the title seemed a bit flat without the numeral.\n\nThe show featured the Andersons' Supermarionation, a form of puppetry first introduced in Four Feather Falls and Supercar and used again in their subsequent productions such as Stingray and Captain Scarlet. Thirty-nine black and white half-hour episodes of Fireball XL5 were made on 35mm film: all future Anderson series were produced in colour.\n\nSeveral Anderson series have been shown in syndication in the US, but Fireball XL5 is the only Anderson series to have run on a US network. NBC ran the series in its Saturday morning children's block from 1963 through to September 1965.\n\nA similar programme often confused with Fireball XL5 is Space Patrol, produced by Gerry Anderson's ex business partner and co-founder of AP Films, Arthur Provis due to a number of similarities and settings.", "poster_path": "/rBv16DzgKuzvx13KweU2nltONXU.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [10759, 16, 10765], "popularity": 5.5257, "first_air_date": "1962-10-28", "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 11, "origin_country": ["GB"]}]}]}
