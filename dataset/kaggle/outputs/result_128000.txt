Although they have grown separately with their souls full of prejudices against their respective families, the two cannot avoid feeling attracted to each other. Margarita will not permit this and so she tells her husband to make sure her son will never be together with Alfonsina so he could marry Barbara, her cousin's daughter. Justo rapes Alfonsina and she leaves along with her mom and her aunt. Five years later... Alfonsina is graduating from school and has a good life until her mother commits suicide because she found out she was deathly ill and could no longer live with the guilt of her lifestyle.
