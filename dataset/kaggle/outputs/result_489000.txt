It began in 1989 on BBC One and ran for four series, with the last episode shown in 1994. The show was a partially musical comic retelling of the legend of Robin Hood, placing Maid Marian in the role of leader of the Merry Men, and reducing Robin to an incompetent ex-tailor.\n\nThe programme was much appreciated by children and adults alike, and has been likened to Blackadder, not only for its historical setting and the presence of Tony Robinson, but also for its comic style. It is more surreal than Blackadder, however, and drops even more anachronisms. Many of the show's cast such as Howard Lew Lewis, Forbes Collins, Ramsay Gilderdale and Patsy Byrne had previously appeared in various episodes of Blackadder alongside Robinson. Like many British children's programmes, there is a lot of social commentary sneakily inserted, as well as witty asides about the Royal family, buses running on time, etc. Many of the plots spoofed or referenced film and television shows including other incarnations of Robin Hood in those mediums.", "poster_path": "/6baSwjPEaMn7egL8VP7P9dr2lcd.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10751], "popularity": 4.9175, "first_air_date": "1989-11-16", "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 13, "origin_country": ["GB"]}, {"backdrop_path": "/y1bstk8A5AxHMKQXDq2vm6LLpbY.jpg", "id": 24077, "title": "The Tall Guy", "original_title": "The Tall Guy", "overview": "An American actor in England tries to find love and work.", "poster_path": "/6tGHCij3jJu80RYSSpV0LBRLTN3.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10749], "popularity": 0.7387, "release_date": "1989-02-01", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 72}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 24660, "name": "The Hello Girls", "original_name": "The Hello Girls", "overview": "From 1959 to 1961, the lives of five telephone operators in Derby.", "poster_path": "/vnXFwSUY6oeWxq2XJ2pV3UFwFBE.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "popularity": 2.3851, "first_air_date": "1996-09-05", "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 2, "origin_country": ["GB"]}]}]}
