Karren Brady made her debut on Junior Apprentice, as it aired before she appeared on the adult version. The programme concluded with Sugar awarding the prize fund to 17-year-old Arjun Rajyagor, with Tim Ankers finishing in second place.\n\nThe second series started in October 2011, and this time featured eight episodes and twelve contestants. The series was won by Zara Brownless, with James McCullagh as runner-up.\n\nThe third series started on 1 November 2012, also with twelve contestants. The series concluded on 20 December, and was won by Ashleigh Porter-Exley, with Lucy Beauvallet as runner-up. Maria Doran and Patrick McDowell finished in joint third place.\n\nOriginally proposed in March 2008 and confirmed in June 2009, Junior Apprentice received mostly positive reviews from critics. The programme is a spin-off from the series The Apprentice, which was in turn spawned from an American series of the same name, featuring the entrepreneur Donald Trump.

It ran for twelve regular episodes on ITV, plus two Christmas specials. The first seven aired for the first time in 1987, the next seven in 1989. It was directed by Ian Hamilton and Alasdair MacMillan and produced by London Weekend Television.\n\nRegulars on the program, besides Dame Edna, were her \"bridesmaid\" Madge Allsop and Robin Houston who was the announcer, with orchestra conducted and arranged by Laurie Holloway.\n\nEach program featured several celebrity guests, usually three, but some programs included up to eight guests. There would also be other invited \"guests\" like Kurt Waldheim and Imelda Marcos who once introduced at stage right would fall victim to a trap door or something similar and fail to make it to their chair.\n\nThe entire series was released on DVD by BBC Video in June 2004, and can now also be purchased as a complete set including the Christmas specials and the three An Audience with Dame Edna specials, plus other material.\n\nThe series was released for Region 2 by Network DVD in the UK in 2007, as a 4-disc set. For reasons unknown, the Region 2 release does not include the 1989 Christmas special \"The Dame Edna Satellite Experience\" that ended the second series and featured Ursula Andress, Yehudi Menuhin, and Robert Kilroy-Silk.
