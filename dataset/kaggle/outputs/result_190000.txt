The programme was set \u2013 as the title suggests \u2013 in Ward B1, the children's ward of the fictitious South Park Hospital, and told the stories of the young patients and the staff present there. Aimed at older children and teenagers, Children's Ward was a long-lived series for a children's drama, starting life in 1988 as a contribution to the Dramarama anthology strand, \"Blackbird Singing In The Dead of Night\", then first broadcast as a series 1989 and running from then until 2000.\n\nThe series was conceived by Granada staff writers Paul Abbott and Kay Mellor, both of whom went on to enjoy successful careers as award-winning writers of adult television drama. At the time, they were both working on the soap opera Coronation Street, and had recently collaborated on a script for Dramarama.\n\nAbbott, who had been through a troubled childhood himself, had initially wanted to set the series in a children's care home rather than a hospital, but this was vetoed by Granada executives. During the course of its run, however, Children's Ward won many plaudits for covering difficult issues such as cancer, alcoholism, drug addiction and child abuse in a sensitive manner. The programme won many awards, including in 1996 a BAFTA Children's Award for Best Drama, won by an episode in which a serial killer lures children to him via the internet and is \u2013 highly unusually for children's television \u2013 not eventually caught.", "poster_path": "/lu65YnPqhvMj1iOoCeT5WqLxOrz.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [18, 10762], "popularity": 11.926, "first_air_date": "1989-03-15", "vote_average": 3.5, "vote_count": 2, "origin_country": ["GB"]}]}]}
