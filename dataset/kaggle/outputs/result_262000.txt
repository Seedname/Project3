Though it shares a title with the feature film The Hunger the series has no direct plot or character connection to the film, and was created by Jeff Fazio.\n\nOriginally shown on the Sci Fi Channel in the UK, The Movie Network in Canada and Showtime in the US, the series was broadcast from 1997 to 2000, and is internally organized into two seasons. Each episode was based around an independent story introduced by the host; Terence Stamp hosted each episode for the first season, and was replaced in the second season by David Bowie. Stories tended to focus on themes of self-destructive desire and obsession, with a strong component of soft-core erotica; popular tropes for the stories included cannibalism, vampires, sex, and poison.", "poster_path": "/5dZUGpa3KtFM9pwIPhLSKNBIz83.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 8.2476, "first_air_date": "1997-07-20", "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 36, "origin_country": ["CA", "US", "GB"]}]}]}

Brinkmann's life outside of the public eye was every bit as turbulent as his public image, though in different ways -- he had a stormy relationship with his wife and their son was severely handicapped. Filmmaker Harald Bergmann wrote and directed Brinkmanns Zorn (aka Brinkmann's Wrath), a biographical drama which stars Eckhard Rhode as Brinkmann and Alexandra Finder as his spouse. Brinkmanns Zorn was screened in competition at the 2007 Rotterdam International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster_path": "/ecPDXVF8FjfiXGC9RN0Va4cF1nO.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [], "popularity": 0.0546, "release_date": "2007-01-11", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 4}, {"backdrop_path": "/jeckZdwEiCU6dvG2cjdMcF3wrQg.jpg", "id": 517972, "title": "Swimming", "original_title": "Schwimmen", "overview": "Elisa and Anthea support each other through the difficulties of adolescence.
