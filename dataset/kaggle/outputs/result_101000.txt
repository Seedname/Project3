He is helped by \"Billy the Kerr\" and quite often frustrated by the local bookmaker Albert Welshman. Liz Fraser played Sid's long-suffering girlfriend who has been waiting for seven years for Sid to set the date.\n\nChanges were made to the format after the first series. Sid James' character was changed to be something of a people's champion, campaigning for social justice. Bill Kerr and Liz Fraser departed and Sidney Tafler played a different character: Charlie Davenport. The location switched from Soho to Sid and Charlie sharing a house.\n\nLater episodes were written by then Morecambe & Wise writers Sid Green and Dick Hills.", "poster_path": "/lCHxYYlOElnwjU3Ki81lLYMZeNy.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35], "popularity": 2.9349, "first_air_date": "1960-11-24", "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 5, "origin_country": ["GB"]}]}]}
