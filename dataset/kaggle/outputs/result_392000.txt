Andy Griffith portrays the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. His life is complicated by an inept, but well-meaning deputy, Barney Fife, a spinster aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee, and a precocious young son, Opie. Local ne'er-do-wells, bumbling pals, and temperamental girlfriends further complicate his life. Andy Griffith stated in a Today Show interview, with respect to the time period of the show: \"Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was when we were doing it, of a time gone by.\"\n\nThe series never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and ended its final season at number one. It has been ranked by TV Guide as the 9th-best show in American television history. Though neither Griffith nor the show won awards during its eight-season run, series co-stars Knotts and Bavier accumulated a combined total of six Emmy Awards. The show, a semi-spin-off from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\", spawned its own spin-off series, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., a sequel series, Mayberry R.F.D., and a reunion telemovie, Return to Mayberry. The show's enduring popularity has generated a good deal of show-related merchandise. Reruns currently air on TV Land, and the complete series is available on DVD.

The first series of the show was broadcast from February to May, however, since the second series it has been broadcast from July/August until the grand final in November. The X Factor is produced by FremantleMedia Australia, and is currently broadcast on the Seven Network. The title \"X Factor\" refers to a singing talent which is \"unique\" and \"something\" that makes for star quality. Network Ten held rights for The X Factor in 2005, but dropped the show after the first series due to poor ratings. In 2010, the Seven Network went into a \"bidding war\" to gain rights for the show, and later won and a second series went into production. The X Factor was renewed after a highly successful Australian Idol was no longer broadcast through Network Ten. It is also broadcast in New Zealand on TV3. Two series of The Xtra Factor were broadcast through Network Ten in 2005 and 7Two in 2010. The show was not renewed for a third series in 2011.\n\nThe original judging panel line-up in 2005 consisted of Kate Ceberano, Mark Holden, and John Reid. When the show was revived in 2010, the judging panel was replaced by Ronan Keating, Guy Sebastian, Natalie Imbruglia, and Kyle Sandilands. Imbruglia and Sandilands did not return for series three and were replaced by Melanie Brown and Natalie Bassingthwaighte. Dannii Minogue and Redfoo joined the panel in the fifth series as replacements for Brown and Sebastian. During the televised audition phases of The X Factor, originally the contestants sang in an \"audition room\" in front of just the judges, however, from series two onwards all auditionees sing on stage in an arena, in front of the judges and a live audience.
