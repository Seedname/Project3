It differed in some respects nonetheless. While Tales sometimes dabbled in stories of science fiction and fantasy, this series was more strictly horror. As the name implies, each episode of Monsters featured a different monster which the story concerned, from the animatronic puppet of a fictional children's television program to mutated, weapon-wielding lab rats.\n\nSimilar to Tales, however, the stories in Monsters were rarely very straightforward action plots and often contained some ironic twist in which a character's conceit or greed would do him in, often with gruesome results. Adding to this was a sense of comedy often lost on horror productions which might in some instances lighten the audience's mood but in many cases added to the overall eeriness of the production.", "poster_path": "/fnBz19xGCKc7mfEo9NOeRWIe4iX.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [9648, 10765, 18], "popularity": 9.6596, "first_air_date": "1988-10-22", "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 21, "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"backdrop_path": "/cOCLuGyrPEg24dz0Yu8bCouFQs6.jpg", "id": 97640, "title": "Sleepwalk", "original_title": "Sleepwalk", "overview": "When Nicole, a young copy-shop employee, is hired to translate an ancient Chinese manuscript, she soon finds that the document has strange powers that little by little begin to exert an eerie influence over her life.", "poster_path": "/62SrmxsWg3lRIIVvGV0yiAD3Hzt.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [14, 18, 9648], "popularity": 0.2529, "release_date": "1986-09-09", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 16}]}]}
