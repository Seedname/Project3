The film is named after his famous dance, \"the moonwalk\", which he originally learned as \"the backslide\" but perfected the dance into something no one had seen before. The movie's introduction is a type of music video for Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\" but is not the official video for the song. The film then expresses a montage of Michael's career, which leads into a parody of his Bad video titled \"Badder\", followed by sections \"Speed Demon\" and \"Leave Me Alone\". What follows is the biggest section where Michael plays a hero with magical powers and saves three children from Mr. Big.

Recorded close to transmission, it made use of contemporary news events to give the programme a greater sense of realism. It was created by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin. The series had an ensemble cast, making stars of Haydn Gwynne, Stephen Tompkinson and Neil Pearson.\n\nThe series began with the acquisition of GlobeLink by media mogul Sir Roysten Merchant, an allusion to either Robert Maxwell or Rupert Murdoch. Indeed, Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin note on their DVDs that it was fortunate for their libel lawyers that the two men shared the same initials. The series is mostly based on the on-going battle between the staff of GlobeLink, led by editor George Dent, as they try to maintain the company as a serious news organisation, and Sir Roysten\u2019s right-hand man Gus Hedges, trying to make the show more sensationalist and suppress stories that might harm Sir Roysten\u2019s business empire.\n\nThe show was awarded the Best Comedy Award at the 1994 BAFTA Awards. At the British Comedy Awards the show won Best New TV Comedy in 1990, Best Channel 4 Comedy in 1991, and Best Channel 4 Sitcom in 1994.", "poster_path": "/btHvMfyEoFJaoJeCaOFWhC1kUzC.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35], "popularity": 14.4316, "first_air_date": "1990-08-09", "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 25, "origin_country": ["GB"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 325986, "title": "Amnesty International's Big 30", "original_title": "Amnesty International's Big 30", "overview": "In the tradition of the acclaimed series of British concerts known as The Secret Policemen's Ball, Amnesty International celebrates its 50th Anniversary live at Radio City Music Hall.", "poster_path": "/kossqJ1d4xxf4ynQOHvxN9U8cj3.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [99, 35], "popularity": 0.227, "release_date": "1991-12-28", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 1}, {"backdrop_path": "/3vsQurBLHdthkTIMTEE3a5ebHyI.jpg", "id": 3641, "name": "The Young Person's Guide to Becoming a Rock Star", "original_name": "The Young Person's Guide to Becoming a Rock Star", "overview": "The Young Person's Guide to Becoming a Rock Star is a British comedy series, which aired on Channel 4 in 1998.

The show aired Monday nights on TNT, going head-to-head with the World Wrestling Federation's Monday Night Raw from September 4, 1995 to March 26, 2001. Production ceased shortly after WCW was purchased by the WWF.\n\nThe debut of Nitro began the Monday Night Wars, a ratings battle between the WWF and WCW that lasted for almost six years and saw each company resort to cutthroat tactics to try to compete with the competition. In mid-1996, Nitro began to draw better ratings than Raw based on the strength of the nWo storyline, an anarchist wrestling stable that wanted to take over WCW. Nitro continued to beat Raw for 84 consecutive weeks, forcing WWE owner Vince McMahon to change the way he did business. As the nWo storyline grew stagnant, fan interest in the storyline waned, and Raw began to edge out Nitro in the ratings.\n\nThe turning point for the organizations came during the January 4, 1999 broadcast of Nitro, during which lead commentator Tony Schiavone gave away the results of matches for that night's Raw broadcast. As Raw was taped and Nitro was live, Bischoff believed that knowing the outcome would dissuade viewers from watching the program. Excited by the prospect of seeing perennial WWF underdog Mick Foley win the WWF Championship, a large number of Nitro viewers changed channels to watch Raw, switching back to Nitro after Foley won the title. From that week forward, Raw beat Nitro in the ratings by a significant amount, and WCW was never able to regain the success it once had.", "poster_path": "/4wxkWyoqOqaRgSwQiPOAXdF5FNL.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [10759, 18], "popularity": 9.9001, "first_air_date": "1995-09-04", "vote_average": 8.4, "vote_count": 32, "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"backdrop_path": "/jTgTeMmYmyFuCPhb7HnolUKBTDQ.jpg", "id": 230755, "title": "WCW Bash at the Beach 1999", "original_title": "WCW Bash at the Beach 1999", "overview": "\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage joins forces with Sid Vicious to take on Sting & Kevin Nash.
