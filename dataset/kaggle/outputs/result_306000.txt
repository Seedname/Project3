Avantazh) is a 1977 Bulgarian drama film directed by Georgi Djulgerov. It was entered into the 28th Berlin International Film Festival, where Djulgerov won the Silver Bear for Best Director. The action takes place during the socialist period in Bulgaria. The central character, nicknamed the Cock is an artistic personality, a man of strong character known as the king of the pickpockets. His keen sense of personal freedom comes up against the universally accepted norms of behavior. The Cock likes a game, adventure and danger, while socialist society needs obedience. The Cock makes a stand against this order; he does not want to play his games according to rules. He is telling his story of two decades: his imprisonment and his love affairs.", "poster_path": "/gDFLg66seJ99sXAUdC3vMjwy0w8.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "bg", "genre_ids": [18], "popularity": 0.1246, "release_date": "1977-10-10", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 4}]}]}
