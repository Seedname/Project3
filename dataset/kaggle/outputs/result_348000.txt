The first season cast included Robert Sutherland Telfer, Jonathan Angel, Isaac Lidsky, Natalia Cigliuti, Bianca Lawson, and Bonnie Russavage. Unlike the original series, which featured very few major cast changes throughout its run, The New Class regularly changed its core cast with Mr. Belding being the only constant factor.\n\nThe series was universally panned by critics and most fans of the original series and is one of the worst reviewed teen shows, but had a positive reception to new fans of the franchise.", "poster_path": "/eq88yhvao0bzpPecjWjkVrevZ5P.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [10751, 35], "popularity": 39.3133, "first_air_date": "1993-09-11", "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 40, "origin_country": ["US"]}]}]}
