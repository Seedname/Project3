Ansara had earlier appeared in the series Broken Arrow, having portrayed the Apache chief, Cochise. Ansara, however, was not Native American but of Syrian descent.\n\nAnsara played Sam Buckhart, an Apache Indian who saved the life of a U.S. Cavalry officer after an Indian ambush. When the officer died, he left Sam money that was used for an education at private schools and Harvard University. After school, he returned to New Mexico where he became a Deputy Marshal working for Marshal Andy Morrison. He lived in a boarding house run by Martha Commager. The only other continuing character was 8-year old Tess Logan, an orphan who had been rescued by Buckhart. Robert Harland, later of Target: The Corruptors! starred in seven episodes as Deputy Billy Lordan. Wayne Rogers, who went on to star in another Four Star western, Stagecoach West, and later, M*A*S*H, also played deputy Lordan in several episodes.", "poster_path": "/tReblyXSokbKbsxNKcDdsySmaMx.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [37], "popularity": 9.0799, "first_air_date": "1959-10-01", "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 2, "origin_country": ["US"]}]}]}

But the spring is not the real reason for the hatred between the families. Justo Ramirez, married to Margarita Insunza, had a relationship with Francisca Rivero, wife of his enemy and neighbor Rigoberto Valdes. This relationship, founded in the betrayal, will cause the utmost bitterness and the destruction between the two families. The Valdes have a beautiful daughter named Alfonsina, who was born in the same year as Alejandro, the son and heir of the Ramirez. Although they have grown separately with their souls full of prejudices against their respective families, the two cannot avoid feeling attracted to each other. Margarita will not permit this and so she tells her husband to make sure her son will never be together with Alfonsina so he could marry Barbara, her cousin's daughter. Justo rapes Alfonsina and she leaves along with her mom and her aunt. Five years later... Alfonsina is graduating from school and has a good life until her mother commits suicide because she found out she was deathly ill and could no longer live with the guilt of her lifestyle. Before dying, her mother confesses to Alfonsina that Justo Ramirez destroyed her life and after that Alfonsina vows revenge on the man who destroyed her family. She returns to San Andres and there she once again sees Alejandro who is now engaged to Barbara. Their love is still present in their hearts. They will have to fight for their love and see if they can be happy by the shores of El Manantial... \n\nEl Manantial is a Mexican telenovela that first aired in 2001, starring Adela Noriega and Mauricio Islas.

Many episodes tackled difficult topics such as drug use, child abuse, teenage pregnancy, homosexuality, homophobia, racism, and divorce, and the series was acclaimed for its sensitive and realistic portrayal of the challenges of teenage life. The cast comprised mainly non-professional actors, which added to the show's sense of realism.\n\nThe series featured many of the same actors who had starred on The Kids of Degrassi Street a few years earlier, including Stacie Mistysyn, Neil Hope, Anais Granofsky, Sarah Charlesworth and others. However, their character names and family situations had been changed, so Degrassi Junior High cannot, therefore, be considered a direct spinoff.\n\nThe legal counsel for all the episodes was Stephen Stohn who later became the executive producer of Degrassi: The Next Generation.
