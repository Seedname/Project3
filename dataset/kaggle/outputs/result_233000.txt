To prove this the professor promises the hand of his daughter R\u00f3zsi (Katalin Kar\u00e1dy) and all his possessions to the one who is willing to try the 'space travel' with him in his machine. The romantic and adventurous Hungarian count \u00c1kos Tibor (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szilassy) finally accepts the challenge. For the count's luck before the time travel he attends a costume ball dressed as a Hungarian hussar.
