It also featured the Saturday Chart, which although was unofficial, usually reflected the new chart positions a day before the official chart was announced on Radio 1. This made the BBC's long-running Top of the Pops, which aired only the night before, seem very out-of-date broadcasting the previous week's chart. CD:UK later utilised an interactive chart based on viewers' votes, called the MiTracks Countdown. From 1999 to 2004, the show was sponsored by Tizer.\n\nIn 2002, the programmes was criticised for showing \"raunchy\" performances in a slot aimed at children, sparked by a performance of \"Dirrty\" by Christina Aguilera.
