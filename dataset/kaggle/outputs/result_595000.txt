After a successful three-part pilot aired they were given their own show on YLE's channel 2 with a completely new look. The Kummeli TV show was primarily composed of skits with insane characters, but would also feature musical guests as the core crew of the team were actually musicians rather than professional actors. Some episodes would also have a running set of skits that would reach a conclusion at the end of the episode.\n\nIn the mid-90s, after the end of the show, the Kummeli crew would make random appearances on TV and at different events.
