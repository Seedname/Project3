A second one-hour special was then broadcast in the summer of 1984 - in that programme it was announced that Micro Live would be back on BBC2 as a regular monthly one-hour series starting in October of that year.\n\nA second season of Micro Live launched in 1985 as a weekly half-hour programme and was followed by a third series of weekly half-hour shows in 1986. The series broadcast its last programme in 1987.\n\nThe scope of the programme was much wider than the preceding computer series and had a less formal feel due to its 'live' nature - not only did it cover more subject areas but it also featured more microcomputers instead of its main focus being the BBC Micro.

However that changed when Sat.1 decided to drop the show from its line-up and sixx was announced to air the remaining episodes; with a one-hour series finale on September 2, 2011.\n\nThe show focuses around a fictional high school in Cologne and tackles with young love, a marriage crisis, a mysterious disappearance, schemes and competition fights, coming out, drug abuse, career chances and forbidden feelings. Hand aufs Herz also introduces something completely new to the genre of a soap opera by including music and dance as one of the main elements.\n\nIt has been compared to the successful American television show a hit TV show, Glee and the High School Musical franchise. Even though it started out as a musical series, the show shifts its stories from that plot even though it remains a part of the series.\n\nHand aufs Herz started two weeks after the failed daily drama Eine wie keine aired its final episode due to low ratings. The show is in direct competition with the long-running soap opera Verbotene Liebe and is starring with Vanessa Jung and Andreas Jancke two of its former stars.", "poster_path": null, "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "de", "genre_ids": [10766], "popularity": 59.7998, "first_air_date": "2010-10-04", "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1, "origin_country": ["DE"]}, {"backdrop_path": null, "id": 361663, "title": "M\u00e4nner sind zum Abgew\u00f6hnen", "original_title": "M\u00e4nner sind zum Abgew\u00f6hnen", "overview": "36-year-old movement therapist Marlene Hagedorn has come to terms with her status as the single mother of three vivacious daughters.
