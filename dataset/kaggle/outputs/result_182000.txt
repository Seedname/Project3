Chapman and produced by Thames Television for ITV between 7 March 1984 and 23 October 1986.

William works while Hester keeps home. The crux of the show was that she was always looking to try new hobbies or find ways to improve her life, much of which exasperated her hard-working husband.\n\nThe family home had a granny flat attached, in which Hester's mother Nancy lived. She was divorced from Hester's father Guy although remarried him as the series progressed. The couple had a daughter called Emma who frequently telephoned but never appeared. Her husband Peter did appear often. They later had a son \u2014 the Fields' first grandchild \u2014 whom they named Guy, after his great-grandfather.\n\nPerhaps, the best remembered supporting character was Sonia Barrett who would frequently pop round to borrow items to replace hers due to breakage, theft or mislaying. Hester was not perturbed by this, as the two were close friends, but it used to irritate William. Sonia had the show's only catchphrase \u2014 she would always knock on the back door of the Fields' home and then say It's only Sonia! as she walked in. This would sometimes lead to applause of recognition from the studio audience, a phenomenon more regularly seen within American sitcoms.

Two series were produced, with a total of 26 episodes.\n\nJanus was a spin-off series from the earlier ABC-TV crime series Phoenix.\n\nLoosely based on the true story of Melbourne's Pettingill family and the Walsh Street police shootings, Janus follows the bitterly-fought prosecutions of a notorious criminal family, the Hennesseys, from the viewpoints of the family, the police and, in particular, the lawyers, prosecutors, barristers and judges involved in all aspects of the story.\n\nWhen the series begins, four members of the infamous Hennessey clan are acquitted of the shooting of two young policemen in a bungled bank heist. The city of Melbourne is shocked as brothers Mal and Steve, along with brother-in-law Darren Mack and friend Ken Hardy, walk free.\n\nThe prosecutors, judges, magistrates and police\u2014many modelled heavily on real-life legal figures\u2014are determined to put the Hennessey members behind bars if they can. But corruption, legal loopholes, delays, and stretched resources combine to make the quest to jail the group far from straightforward.", "poster_path": "/uOVsNtECSWbRFgYw1Nzb9Bxy7zs.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [18, 80], "popularity": 4.9233, "first_air_date": "1994-09-01", "vote_average": 9.0, "vote_count": 1, "origin_country": ["AU"]}]}]}

The show aired Monday nights on TNT, going head-to-head with the World Wrestling Federation's Monday Night Raw from September 4, 1995 to March 26, 2001. Production ceased shortly after WCW was purchased by the WWF.\n\nThe debut of Nitro began the Monday Night Wars, a ratings battle between the WWF and WCW that lasted for almost six years and saw each company resort to cutthroat tactics to try to compete with the competition. In mid-1996, Nitro began to draw better ratings than Raw based on the strength of the nWo storyline, an anarchist wrestling stable that wanted to take over WCW. Nitro continued to beat Raw for 84 consecutive weeks, forcing WWE owner Vince McMahon to change the way he did business. As the nWo storyline grew stagnant, fan interest in the storyline waned, and Raw began to edge out Nitro in the ratings.\n\nThe turning point for the organizations came during the January 4, 1999 broadcast of Nitro, during which lead commentator Tony Schiavone gave away the results of matches for that night's Raw broadcast. As Raw was taped and Nitro was live, Bischoff believed that knowing the outcome would dissuade viewers from watching the program. Excited by the prospect of seeing perennial WWF underdog Mick Foley win the WWF Championship, a large number of Nitro viewers changed channels to watch Raw, switching back to Nitro after Foley won the title. From that week forward, Raw beat Nitro in the ratings by a significant amount, and WCW was never able to regain the success it once had.", "poster_path": "/4wxkWyoqOqaRgSwQiPOAXdF5FNL.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [10759, 18], "popularity": 9.9001, "first_air_date": "1995-09-04", "vote_average": 8.4, "vote_count": 32, "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"backdrop_path": "/k58kiB6cwaos4cVeKYLH0OJjVup.jpg", "id": 34317, "title": "WWE: The Shawn Michaels Story - Heartbreak & Triumph", "original_title": "WWE: The Shawn Michaels Story - Heartbreak & Triumph", "overview": "", "poster_path": "/6f0C52iZfADzDiAjjvtC5Sjzz5T.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [99], "popularity": 0.3708, "release_date": "2007-11-27", "video": true, "vote_average": 9.3, "vote_count": 3}, {"backdrop_path": "/NRqbM84gqd7L4g9BqNz5WYY6EU.jpg", "id": 863037, "title": "Biography: Shawn Michaels", "original_title": "Biography: Shawn Michaels", "overview": "Chronicles the wild life of one of WWE's greatest performers and most enduring villains.
