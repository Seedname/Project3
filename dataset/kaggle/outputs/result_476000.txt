The television series was based on the original cartoon of the same name, with Jim Backus reprising the voice over of the role he did on TV: while doing this show, he continued with the prime time show Gilligan's Island.\n\nUnlike the theatrical cartoons, which focused on the extremely nearsighted Quincy Magoo's bumbling, the show featured the Magoo character as an actor in adaptations of such literary classics as Don Quixote and Gunga Din. Each of these roles was played seriously, with few if any references to Magoo's nearsightedness; however, introductory segments in each program featured Magoo backstage stumbling into scenery and talking to props, thus connecting the older cartoons to this series. Some stories were contained in a single half-hour episode, but others ran to two and even four episodes. As UPA did not have its own studio facility the production was farmed out to the Grantray-Lawrence and Format Films studios.\n\nAmong the most ambitious adaptations mounted in this format were the four-part Robin Hood, in which he took the role of Friar Tuck; Treasure Island, in which he played the villainous Long John Silver; and a version of Snow White in which he portrayed all seven dwarves.", "poster_path": "/4TKToh9R6SSsHYumqxDX9SukKgJ.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [10751, 16, 35], "popularity": 1.8076, "first_air_date": "1964-09-26", "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 12, "origin_country": ["US"]}]}]}

Ben can't stand Jill's impossibly perfect new boyfriend, and the prospect of spending the entire evening with his former inlaws is nearly too painful to ponder. But this Christmas things are going to be different, because this Christmas might just last forever. At first Kevin resists the curious development by simply reverting to his childish ways, though he is about to find out that sometimes in order to build a better future one must finally make amends with the past. ~ Jason Buchanan", "poster_path": "/51DoG45RuZCiXJc49MA6QUgX1FX.jpg", "media_type": "movie", "adult": false, "original_language": "en", "genre_ids": [35, 10751, 14, 10770], "popularity": 1.0434, "release_date": "2006-12-16", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 42}, {"backdrop_path": "/8l0yJJLJ2F2FrNIJVHLMMRxdryq.jpg", "id": 69898, "title": "The Karen Carpenter Story", "original_title": "The Karen Carpenter Story", "overview": "Story of the meteoric rise and sudden fall of Karen Carpenter, who became a famous singer before battling anorexia and bulimia.
