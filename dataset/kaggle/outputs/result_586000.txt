Widowed and with three children, she is forced to fight for her family and leaves for the paradisiacal beach town of Maramores, where her mother Zoroastra lives. Parallel to the difficulties, L\u00edvia discovers that she is involved in the eternal struggle of Good against Evil.\n\nIn fact, L\u00edvia is the reincarnation of Princess Cec\u00edlia, the eternal passion of the vampire B\u00f3ris Vladescu, who has been pursuing her for centuries. The two met in 7th century Europe, when B\u00f3ris disputed the princess's love with Count Rog\u00e9rio. Nowadays, Rog\u00e9rio was Beto, L\u00edvia's husband, and the two times he faced Boris, his arch-enemy, he took the worst.\n\nBoris is in Maramores to get Cecilia, his immortal beloved. Or rather, Livia, who raises the boy Zeca, who she doesn't even suspect is actually a half-vampire, son of Boris. The vampire is willing to prepare his son to take his place, but Zeca is reluctant to accept his condition, much to his father's despair.\n\nWith B\u00f3ris comes a legion of vampires willing to terrorize the residents of the peaceful city. Among them, the splendid Mina, his wife, and the gallant Victor, who involves the sweet Ci\u00e7a in a game of seduction. Vampires are closely watched by the flustered Galileo Van Burger, a vampire hunter who failed to prevent his wacky son Bart\u00f4 from being bitten.\n\nWho also keeps an eye on the vampires is the mystical Zoroastra, mother of L\u00edvia, a modern witch, who owns the main inn in Maramores. And the mysterious Ezekiel, in reality an angel who came down to Earth to protect L\u00edvia and Zeca from the evil that persecutes them.\n\nEngineer Rodrigo also arrives in the city, followed by his ex-girlfriend Lara. The two are the first victims of vampires. Lara is bitten by Victor and becomes an evil vampire, due to her bad temper. Rodrigo is bitten by Mina, who becomes pregnant and is expecting a daughter from him, which she says is from Boris.\n\nMeanwhile, Rodrigo is used by Boris to approach L\u00edvia. Who does not like this involvement is Augusto, a friend of L\u00edvia who has loved her in the past. Augusto is a widower who raises his small children with the help of sister-in-law Marta, a blind woman, but bitter and Machiavellian, who does everything to keep him from L\u00edvia, because she loves him.", "poster_path": "/fQsnoRyA9Fd0Zw6AUldw4sxrYyR.jpg", "media_type": "tv", "adult": false, "original_language": "pt", "genre_ids": [10766, 10765, 18], "popularity": 52.5325, "first_air_date": "2002-08-26", "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 11, "origin_country": ["BR"]}, {"backdrop_path": "/psedRtpZwLUoDN3d7b2BgPTBtJi.jpg", "id": 42883, "name": "Para\u00edso Tropical", "original_name": "Para\u00edso Tropical", "overview": "The search for a successor provokes the beginning of a clash between two young and talented executives of his group: Daniel Bastos, a lad of simple origins and excellent character, who is not only handsome and charming, but also intelligent and skilled, and Olavo Novaes, an ambitious and unscrupulous man who is ready to fight for the position, at any cost.
